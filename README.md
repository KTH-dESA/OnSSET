# OnSSET-2016

In 2016, KTH-dESA researchers have developed an innovative geospatial electrification model called the Open Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit (**OnSSET**). 

OnSSET is  a bottom up, least cost electrification modelling tool, that estimates the most cost effective electrification option (grid, mini grid & stand-alone) for the achievement of electricity access goals. To do so, OnSSET takes into account spatially explicit characteristics related to energy. Such data include population distribution, proximity to transmission and road network, nighttime lights, local renewable energy potential among others.

OnSSET focuses on the assessment and deployment of conventional and renewable energy technologies aiming at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. It is a complementary approach to existing energy planning models which do not consider geographical characteristics related to energy and aims to provide invaluable support to policy and decision makers on least-cost electrification strategies.

OnSSET-2016 was initially applied to Nigeria, Ethiopia and India, featuring in the World Energy Outlook 2014 and 2015 and the Global Tracking Framework 2015. It has also been applied to 44 Sub-Saharan African and 10 Latin American countries as part of the [Universal Electrification Access](https://un-modelling.github.io/modelling-tools/#geo-electricity) led by the United Nations.

# PyOnSSET

The **PyOnSSET** folder contains the (python) scripts on which OnSSET is based upon. Together there are two sample files required for testing the model on you local machine.

OnSSET-2016 requires python 3; best to install through [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
